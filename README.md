# Nurtree 

The goal of this project was to demonstrate the advanced capabilities of the NextJS framework by applying it to a practical use-case scenario involving dynamic rendering with a substantial data set.

Features of NextJS include but are not limited to:

| **Feature**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Routing**        | A file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.                |
| **Rendering**      | Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server with Next.js. Streaming on Edge and Node.js runtimes. |
| **Data Fetching**  | Simplified data fetching with async/await in Server Components, and an extended fetch API for request memoization, data caching, and revalidation.            |
| **Styling**        | Support for your preferred styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS.                                                               |
| **Optimizations**  | Image, Fonts, and Script Optimizations to improve your application's Core Web Vitals and User Experience.                                                     |
| **TypeScript**     | Improved support for TypeScript, with better type checking and more efficient compilation, as well as custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker.              |

# Authentication

NextJS features API routes, NextAuth, and Providers to implement secure authorization flow using jwt, sessions, and callbacks:

The application will generate a page based on the track details, and retrieve the top matching music video from youtube. The player acts autonomously and automatically as it should. When the video ends, an app event will trigger and send a request for a dynamic slug route to the server component (NextJS App router and navigation feature) with the next video and track details, and render the new page. This rendering is lazily loaded, only getting the video iframe and spotify embed details when its route is active.
